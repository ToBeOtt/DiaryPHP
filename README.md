======== Brief overview ========

I have used PHP and laravel in order to achieve the objectives. I have tried following the best practices that I've read up on online.

I do that commenting on functions etc is important, in this simple crud-application however I felt that most code was very self-explanatory. I have used a few libraries, such as Carbon for date-handling for example.

For the middleware I set up a kernel.php, I noticed that it seamed to be a few different ways this could be done thought. I added tailwind for quick and easy frontend css-handling.

======== Regarding the application ========

This is a simple diary-application. There is one user seeded with credentials:
Username: varbi@mail.com
password: Varbi123

Four diary-messages are seeded. These are randomly generated by laravels factory-method. There is functionality for adding, editing and deleting (soft delete)
messages. DB is default sql-lite.

======== Running the application ========

If cloned from github and NO docker is on your system:
To run application, opem two terminals:

-   In first, write 'npm run dev' (for tailwind to compile)
-   In secord, write 'php artisan serve' (if this is the same path-variables on your system)

Else, if docker is installed

-   Open powershell, navigate to root-folder of application where the dockerfile is.
-   type 'docker-compose build'
-   type 'docker-compose up'
    open browser, navigate to http://localhost

Hopefully one of these alternatives works.
